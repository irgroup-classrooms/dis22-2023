When creating the queries think of what Karen is interested. What information does Karen need to fulfill their goal of write a short article for the church magazine?. 
Make sure the queries are as realistic as possible. That means that when writing the queries use words that are realistic given that Karen is 45 years old.

Consider that Karen is from texas if the topic can have a relation to texas. Formulate your words as a non academical english native. When writing the Queries also remember that Karen is female. 
Format the queries as one python dictionary, where the keys are `keywords`, `questions` and `queries`. Write them with the following steps:

1. (keywords): Identify important keywords that fit to what Karen needs to know to reach their goal of write a short article for the church magazine about the topic. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries and do not find more than 3 keywords!!

3. (Queries): Rewrite the questions and consider that they have to fit roughly into 4 words and that they’re not formulated as a question and without a question mark. Remeber that each query has to speak for itself.

Format the queries as one python dictionary, where the keys are `keywords`, `questions` and `queries`. Write them with the following steps:

1. (keywords): Identify important keywords that fit to what Markus needs to know to reach their goal of create a ten minute presentation about the topic. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries and do not find more than 3 keywords!!
2. (Questions):  Try to formulate questions that are as realistic as possible given the description of Markus and the topic. Use the keywords to formulate the questions. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries!!
3. (Queries): Rewrite the questions and consider that they have to fit roughly into 4 words and that they’re not formulated as a question and without a question mark. Remeber that each query has to speak for itself.

196,646,"I want you to formulate queries about a specific topic. When writing the queries write them in the style of Edith who wants to identify relevant document for the specific topic, to fulfill their goal of researching background information. 
When creating the queries think of what Edith is interested. What information does Edith need to fulfill their goal of researching background information?. 
Make sure the queries are as realistic as possible. That means that when writing the queries use words that are realistic given that Edith is 75 years old.

1. (keywords): Identify important keywords that fit to what Edith needs to know to reach their goal of researching background information about the topic. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries and do not find more than 3 keywords!!
2. (Questions):  Try to formulate questions that are as realistic as possible given the description of Edith and the topic. Use the keywords to formulate the questions. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries!!
3. (Queries): Rewrite the questions and consider that they have to fit roughly into 4 words and that they’re not formulated as a question and without a question mark. Remeber that each query has to speak for itself.
