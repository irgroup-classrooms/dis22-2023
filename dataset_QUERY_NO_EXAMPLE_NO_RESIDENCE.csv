Formulate your words like an english native would. When writing the Queries also remember that Edith is female. 
Format the queries as one python dictionary, where the keys are `keywords`, `questions` and `queries`. Write them with the following steps:

1. (keywords): Identify important keywords that fit to what Edith needs to know to reach their goal of researching background information about the topic. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries and do not find more than 3 keywords!!
2. (Questions):  Try to formulate questions that are as realistic as possible given the description of Edith and the topic. Use the keywords to formulate the questions. Remember that the topic itself is not a keyword but has to appear in all queries!!
3. (Queries): Rewrite the questions and consider that they have to fit roughly into 4 words and that they’re not formulated as a question and without a question mark. Remeber that each query has to speak for itself. 

Use the following framework for the dictionary: 

{
""keywords"": [""keyword 1"", ""keyword 2"", ""keyword 3""],
""questions"" : {
1 : ""question 1"", 
2: ""question 2"", 
3: ""question 3"",
... ; ..., 
n : ""question n""
},
""queries"" : {
1 : ""querie 1"", 
2 : ""querie 2"", 
3 : ""querie 3"",
... : ...,
n :  ""querie n""
}
}

Please generate 10 search queries that could have been written by Edith to do research on the following.
Topic: U.S., investment, Africa.
Description: What is the extent of U.S. (government and private) investment in sub-Saharan Africa?","{'keywords': ['U.S.', 'investment', 'Africa'], 'questions': {'1': 'What is U.S. investment?', '2': 'What is private investment?', '3': 'What is government investment?', '4': 'What is sub-Saharan Africa?', '5': 'What is the extent?', '6': 'What is the impact?', '7': 'What are the benefits?', '8': 'What are the risks?', '9': 'What are the challenges?', '10': 'What are the opportunities?'}, 'queries': {'1': 'U.S. investment in Africa', '2': 'Private investment in Africa', '3': 'Government investment in Africa', '4': 'Sub-Saharan Africa definition', '5': 'Extent of investment Africa', '6': 'Impact of U.S. investment', '7': 'Benefits of investment Africa', '8': 'Risks of investment Africa', '9': 'Challenges of investment Africa', '10': 'Opportunities for investment'}}",Edith
