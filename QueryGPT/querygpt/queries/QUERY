I want you to formulate queries about a specific topic. When writing the queries write them in the style of $PERSONA_NAME who wants to identify relevant document for the specific topic, $TOPIC, to fulfill their goal of $PERSONA_GOAL. When creating the queries think of what $PERSONA_NAME is interested in given their profession $PERSONA_PROFESSION. What information does $PERSONA_NAME need to fulfill their goal of $PERSONA_GOAL?. Make sure the queries are as realistic as possible. That means that when writing the queries use words that are realistic given that $PERSONA_NAME is $PERSONA_AGE years old. (Would a $PERSONA_AGE year old use words like $PERSONA_WORD_EXAMPLE.) Also add here roughly to the length of $PERSONA_QUERY_LENGTH words, as it would be unrealistic for $PERSONA_NAME to write different length queries. Consider that $PERSONA_NAME is from $PERSONA_RESIDENCE if $TOPIC can have a relation to $PERSONA_RESIDENCE. Formulate your words $PERSONA_COMPLEXITY. When writing the Queries also remember that $PERSONA_NAME is $PERSONA_GENDER. 
Format the queries as a python dictionary. Write them with the following steps:

1. (keywords): Take keywords out of the description “$DESCRIPTION” and identify important keywords that fit to what $PERSONA_NAME needs to know to reach their goal of $PERSONA_GOAL.
2. (Questions): Use the keywords to formulate realistic full sentence questions.
3. (Queries): Rewrite the questions and consider that they have to fit roughly into $PERSONA_QUERY_LENGTH words and that they’re not formulated as a question and without a question mark.
